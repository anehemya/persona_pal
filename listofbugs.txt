1) Specifically for the CreateSurvey page, when you zoom in on the page, an error occurs.
"ERROR
ResizeObserver loop completed with undelivered notifications.
    at handleError (http://localhost:3000/static/js/bundle.js:87047:58)
    at http://localhost:3000/static/js/bundle.js:87066:7"
Interestingly, this error does not occur on the SurveyView page.
